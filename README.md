# Wasteagram

## Introduction
Wasteagram is an 'Instagram-like' app for tracking food waste. This app contains a list of posts containing food wastes, where each post contains the day the post was taken, the location it was taken at (latitude, longitude), a photo of the wasted food, and a count of how many items were wasted. This app is created so that a restaraunt/cafe can track the number of wasted food items over time to better predict sell quantities.
